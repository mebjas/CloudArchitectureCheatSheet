## What is cloud computing?
*Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services â€” servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more-over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.* - Microsoft Azure

### Top Benefits of cloud computing
 - **Cost**: No more cost of hardware, software license, setting up, maintenance, electricity, network, internet. **That said, cloud services are not cheap either.** 
 - **Speed**: Most cloud services have self service portal, CLI tools to provision required resources in minutes. This eliminates time to setup infrastructure and softwares. Takes pressure off capacity planning.
 - **Global Scale**: Not everyone has the resources to have global datacenters yet it's really a good idea to have servers sitting close to customers for faster service. With cloud this is possible for everyone.
 - **Productivity**: No need to think of racking and stacking, focus on your application.
 - **Performance**: The quality of infrastructure held by popular cloud computing platforms are much better than many can setup. They generally host latest generation of hardware and software.
 - **Security**: Most of the tools and software have strengthened security in place.

## Availability
Simply put if you are building a cloud service, it's to serve certain ***customers***, certain ***something**. Availability refers to uptime of this ***something***. It's generally quantified in percentage of time you are able to provide this ***something*** to each customer. 90% availability means you were up for 9 out of 10 hours.
